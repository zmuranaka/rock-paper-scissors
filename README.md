# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## What is this Project?

This project is the classic game of rock-paper-scissors and two variants of the game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The rps_classic.html page is the game of rock-paper-scissors as everyone knows, and the two variants explain the rules when loaded.
