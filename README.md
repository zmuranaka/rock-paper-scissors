# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## What is this Project?

This project is the classic game of rock-paper-scissors and two variations, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What are the Different Versions of the Game?

### Classic

This is the classic game of rock-paper-scissors as everyone knows. The winner is the first player to reach three points. Good luck!

### Gambling

This is rock-paper-scissors with a gambling twist. You begin with 1000 credits, and can bet your credits to win more. The game lasts nine rounds, and each round you may bet as little as zero and up to the amount of credits you have. If you win the round, you earn credits equal to what you bet, and if you lose, you lose that many credits. The catch is, if you tie, on your next bet you have to bet double! This may seem like complete luck, but you are not guessing completely blind - the computer will always choose each choice (rock, paper, or scissors) exactly three times. Keep track of what the computer has already chosen and amass the biggest bank possible!

### Reverse

This is rock-paper-scissors reversed. The game lasts 60 seconds, and each round the computer will show you what they have chosen, and then tell you whether you need to win, tie, or lose against their choice. For example, if they show you rock and say you need to lose, you need to pick scissors. If you pick correctly to fulfill the prompt, you win a point. However, if you pick incorrectly, you lose *two* points. Pick carefully and score as high as you can before time runs out!

## Sources:

I got the GitHub logo from [GitHub](https://github.com/logos). I created the mail logo, link logo, website header, and burger nav icon in Adobe Photoshop, and I created the rock, paper, and scissors images in PicsArt on iPadOS as well as Adobe Photoshop.  
Websites that helped me create the project:  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7540397/convert-nan-to-0-in-javascript  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This webpage taught me how to convert NaN (Not a Number) to zero, which was useful in the gambling JavaScript because the user can enter whatever they want into the text box, but unless it is a number the parseInt will return NaN.  
https://www.w3schools.com/  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W3Schools was very helpful as a general reference.
